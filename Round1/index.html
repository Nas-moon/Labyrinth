        <h2>Labyrinth</h2>
        <p>A labyrinth is a complex, <br> intricate network of pathways <br> designed to challenge navigation. <br> Unlike a maze, which often has <br> multiple paths and dead ends,<br> a labyrinth traditionally has a single,<br>winding route that leads to <br>the center and back out again.<br> Historically, labyrinths were used in <br>ancient cultures for rituals, meditation, <br>and spiritual journeys, symbolizing <br>life’s challenges and the quest for clarity.<br> In modern times, the term is often used<br> metaphorically to describe confusing systems <br>or difficult problems. In games and events,<br> a labyrinth represents a puzzle-like journey<br> where participants must think critically to<br> reach the goal.

        <h2>Invitation</h2>
        <p>The Invitation is your first test. <br>Hidden in plain sight,<br>it waits for only the keen-eyed <br>to uncover. What seems ordinary <br>may not be so — every word,<br> every detail holds meaning. <br>Only by piecing them together<br> will you find the key.<br> Accept the Invitation, and the path<br> to the next round will open. <br>Fail, and the journey ends here.<br>

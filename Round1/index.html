        <h2>Labyrinth</h2
        <p>A labyrinth is a complex, intricate network of pathways designed to challenge navigation. Unlike a maze, which often has multiple paths and dead ends, a labyrinth traditionally has a single, winding route that leads to the center and back out again. Historically, labyrinths were used in ancient cultures for rituals, meditation, and spiritual journeys, symbolizing life’s challenges and the quest for clarity. In modern times, the term is often used metaphorically to describe confusing systems or difficult problems. In games and events, a labyrinth represents a puzzle-like journey where participants must think critically to reach the goal.

        <h2>Invitation</h2>
        <p>The Invitation is your first test. Hidden in plain sight, it waits for only the keen-eyed to uncover. What seems ordinary may not be so — every word, every detail holds meaning. Only by piecing them together will you find the key. Accept the Invitation, and the path to the next round will open. Fail, and the journey ends here.
